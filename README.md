# Predictive-Analysis

The objective of this study was to analyse location data in order to pinpoint the areas with the highest concentration of plastic pollution in North America. Plastic pollution is a global environmental concern that has detrimental effects on ecosystems and human health. The 5 Gyres Institute is dedicated to addressing plastic pollution and conducts primary research in collaboration with scientists, thought leaders, and industry experts. By utilizing data analysis techniques, the project aimed to provide valuable insights into the areas where plastic pollution is most concentrated, enabling targeted intervention and mitigation efforts. The project involved exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and the application of clustering analysis to identify spatial patterns of plastic pollution. The analysis revealed that certain countries, provinces, and cities in North America experienced higher levels of plastic pollution. The findings emphasized the need for effective measures to reduce and manage plastic waste, improve waste management practices, and raise awareness to protect the environment and marine ecosystems. The project's results provide a foundation for future research and interventions to combat plastic pollution in North America.
